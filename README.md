# Hello there!

I am a Cloud Engineering student from the aws/restart program in Birmingham, UK, by Generations UK and Ireland. I have 10 years of experience working with hardware and I'm now looking to make a shift too Cloud. I'm currently very interested in continuing to develop my Python and Cloud skills and learning about AI and Machine Learning.
